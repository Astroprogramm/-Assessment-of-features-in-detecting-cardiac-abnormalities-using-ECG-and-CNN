In this project, a CNN was trained multiple times with electrocardiograms and different features from ECG to analyze which dataset for training gave the best results in accuracy, loss, and false predictions; so that the neural network may potentially be used in clinical decision-making and finally, help a better health outcome of the patient. The obtained results are very promising, with high accuracy, low loss in training, and good performance prediction on data not used in training.
