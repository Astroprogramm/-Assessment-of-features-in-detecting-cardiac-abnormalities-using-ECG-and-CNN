# Assessment of features in detecting cardiac abnormalities using electrocardiograms and convolutional neural network
**Evaluación de parámetros en la detección de anomalías cardiacas mediante electrocardiogramas y red neuronal convolucional**

by *Angela Aguirre*

Description: In this project, a CNN was trained multiple times with electrocardiograms and different features from ECG to analyze which dataset for training gave the best results in accuracy, loss, and false predictions; so that the neural network may potentially be used in clinical decision-making and finally, help a better health outcome of the patient. The obtained results are very promising, with high accuracy, low loss in training, and good performance prediction on data not used in training.

This project was based on the notebook develop by Gregoire DC: Arrhythmia on ECG Classification using CNN | Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/gregoiredc/arrhythmia-on-ecg-classification-using-cnn, with the assistance of professor Juan Marcos Marín from University of Antioquia, and his colleague Iván, an expert in electrocardiography
